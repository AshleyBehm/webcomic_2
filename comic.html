     <p>I started this project with an idea, and my first step was writing up an outline with a basic idea of how I wanted each panel to look. This also helped me plan out the arc of the story, which has changed a lot since this draft  </p>

     <p>My next step was turning the outline into rough sketches. From the beginning, I knew I wanted to use stick figures because they are more fun and comedic! The notes in the margins were my early ideas that I hoped to translate into Illustrator (some worked, and some didn't!). </p>

       <p> I digitized my ideas using Adobe Illustrator. My first step was creating the panels. Originally, the panels were going to be next to each other, but then I decided to format them as a continuous scroll to add to the drama.</p>

   <p>Finally, I began to illustrate and color the panels. This is also where I did most of the writing. My ideas continued to change and evolve as I finished each panel, which is why the final product is very different from the original outline.</p>
